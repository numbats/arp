## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#| label: cars
summary(mtcars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
#| label: fig-plot
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: Fuel efficiency plotted against vehicle weight. Heavier cars use more fuel than lighter cars.
mtcars |>
  ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point()
```

Note that the `echo: false` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot shown in @fig-plot.

# Child documents

```{r}
#| child: file1.qmd, file2.qmd
```



```{r}
#| child: !expr if(FALSE) 'file1.qmd' else 'file2.qmd'
```
