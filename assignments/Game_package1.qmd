title: Game package 1 (10%)
---

You need to work in allocated groups to write an R package to help score or simulate a multi-player game. For example:

* **Ten-pin bowling**: Calculate the score of a game where the inputs are the number of pins knocked down in each throw.
* **Blackjack**: Calculate the score from a round where the inputs are the cards held by the player and the dealer at the end of the game.
* **Poker**: Calculate the winner from a game where the inputs are the cards held by each player at the end of the game. Start with a simple version of poker, and extend to more complex versions.
* **500**: Score a game of 500 where the inputs are the cards played by each player for each trick.
* **Snakes & ladders**: Simulate a game of snakes and ladders on a specified board.
* **Chess**: Simulate a game of chess with random but correct moves by each player.
* **Uno**: Simulate a game of uno with random draws.

You may also have your own ideas for a game. If you would like to do something else, please discuss it with Mitch and Rob first.

The package should have at least 3 user-facing functions, and a vignette that describes how to use the package. The package should be well-documented, with all user-facing functions having examples and unit tests.

Marks will be awarded for clean and efficient code, and for good design.

Please use the team names [allocated on Ed](https://edstem.org/au/courses/21222/discussion/2648997). If you are the first person on your team to accept the assignment, you will need to create the team. Otherwise, you should be able to join the team.
