# Programming paradigms

## Programming paradigms

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="Functional programming (W5)"}
* Functions are created and used like any other object.
* Output should only depend on the function's inputs.
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="Object-oriented programming (W6-W7)"}
* Functions are associated with object types.
* Methods of the same 'function' produce object-specific output.
:::

## Programming paradigms

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="Reactive programming (W8)"}
* Objects are expressed using code based on inputs.
* When inputs change, the object's value updates.
:::

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="Literate programming (W8)"}
* Natural language is interspersed with code.
* Aimed at prioritising documentation/comments.
* Now used to create reproducible reports/documents.

# Reactive programming

## Regular (imperative) programming

Consider how code is usually evaluated...

```{r, eval = FALSE}
a <- 1
b <- 2
x <- a + b
x
```

What is `x`?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
a <- -1
x
```

What is `x` now?

## Regular (imperative) programming

::: {.callout-tip title="Predictable programming"}
All programming we've seen so far evaluates code in sequential order, line by line.

\hspace{1em}

Since `x` was not re-evaluated, its value stays the same even when its inputs have changed.
:::

<!-- . . . -->

<!-- *Note: this is why it's especially important to ensure code works when ran from top to bottom, since when doing a data analysis we often write and run code more freely!* -->

## Reactive programming

Within a reactive programming paradigm, objects *react* to changes in their inputs and automatically update their value!

. . .

::: {.callout-warning title="Disclaimer"}
Reactive programming is a broad and diverse paradigm, we'll focus only on the basic concepts and how they apply in shiny applications.
:::

## Reactive programming

We can implement *reactivity* with functions & environments.

```{r}
library(rlang)
react <- function(e) new_function(alist(), expr(eval(!!enexpr(e))))
```

We'll learn how this function works later (metaprogramming).

Reactive programming is also smarter about *'invalidation'*, results are **cached and reused** if the inputs aren't changed.

## Reactive programming

How does reactive programming differ?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
a <- 1
b <- 2
y <- react(a + b)
y()
```

What is `y`?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
a <- -1
y()
```

What is `y` now?

## Reactive programming

::: {.callout-tip title="(Un)predictable programming?"}
Reactive programming can be disorienting!

\hspace{1em}

Reactive objects *invalidate* whenever their inputs change, and so its value will be recalculated and stay up-to-date.
:::

## Reactive programming

::: {.callout-caution title="Your turn!"}
<!-- Experiment with using `react()` in R. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- library(rlang) -->
<!-- react <- function(e) new_function(alist(), expr(eval(!!enexpr(e)))) -->
<!-- ``` -->

```{r, eval = FALSE}
a <- 1
b <- 2
y <- react(a + b)
y()
```

When was `a + b` evaluated?

\vspace{1em}

How does this differ from ordinary (imperative) code?
:::

## Imperative and declarative programming

\fontsize{13}{13}\sf
::: {.callout-note icon=false title="Imperative programming"}
* Specific commands are carried out immediately.
* Usually direct and exact instructions.
* e.g. read in data from this file.
:::

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="Declarative programming"}
* Specific commands are carried out when needed.
* Expresses higher order goals / constraints.
* e.g. make sure this dataset is up to date every time I see it.
:::

## Imperative and declarative programming

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="Mastering Shiny: Chapter 3 (Basic Reactivity)"}
With imperative code you say “Make me a sandwich”.

\hspace{1em}

With declarative code you say “Ensure there is a sandwich in the refrigerator whenever I look inside of it”.

\hspace{1em}

*Imperative code is **assertive**; *

*declarative code is **passive-aggressive**.*
:::



## Use cases for reactive programming

\fontsize{13}{13}\sf
::: {.callout-important title="Use-less cases"}
This paradigm is rarely needed or used in R for data analysis. 
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Useful cases"}
Reactive programming is useful for developing user applications (including web apps!).

\vspace{1em}

In R, the shiny package uses reactive programming for writing app interactivity.
:::

<!-- ## Invalidation -->

<!-- ## Laziness -->

<!-- ## Debugging -->

# Shiny

## A shiny app

Most shiny apps are organised into several files.

* `ui.R`: The specification of the user interface
* `server.R`: The reactive code that defines app behaviour
* `global.R`: Static global objects used across app
* `www/`: Folder for your web data (images, css, js, etc.)

Simple apps can consist of only an `app.R` script.

## Hello *shiny*!

::: {.callout-caution title="Follow along!"}
Create a shiny app. Save this code as `app.R`.

```r
library(shiny)
ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput("name", "Enter your name: "),
  textOutput("greeting")
)
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$greeting <- renderText({
    sprintf("Hello %s", input$name)
  })
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```
:::

## Hello *shiny*!

::: {.callout-caution title="Follow along!"}
Launch the app by clicking **Run App**.

\vspace{1em}

Use the text input field and see how the webpage changes.

\vspace{1em}

Look at the server code to see how it 'reacts'.
:::


## Shiny reactivity

Reactivity in shiny comprises of:

* Reactive **sources** (inputs):

  UI inputs `input*()` and values `reactiveValues()`

* Reactive **conductors** (intermediates): 

  Expressions `reactive()` and events `eventReactive()`

* Reactive **endpoints** (results): 

  UI outputs `render*()` and side-effects `observe()`

## Reactive graphs

![](../diagrams/reactive/react-graph.png)

The reactivity of an app can be visualised with a graph.

## Reactive graphs

![](../diagrams/reactive/reactlog-components.png)

The graph shows relationships between reactive elements.

## reactlog

\fontsize{12}{12}\sf

The [reactlog package](https://rstudio.github.io/reactlog/) allows you to visualise an app's **reactive graph**.

To **enable logging** of an app's behaviour, run:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
reactlog::reactlog_enable()
```

Then **start, use, and stop your app** to fill the log.

View the log with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
shiny::reactlogShow()
```

Or while your Shiny app is running, press the key combination Ctrl+F3 (Mac: Cmd+F3) to see the reactive log.

## Hello *reactlog*!

::: {.callout-caution title="Follow along!"}
Create a reactive log of the *hello shiny* app.

\vspace{1em}

Start reactlog, then open the app and enter your name.

\vspace{1em}

Close the app and view the log, see how the app reacts to changes to the input text.
:::

## Reactive expressions

Reactive expressions are used in the shiny server as intermediate calculations.

They are expressions wrapped with `reactive()`.

For example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
simulation <- reactive(rnorm(input$n_samples))
```

. . .

The up-to-date value is obtained with `simulation()`.

Whenever the input ID `n_samples` changes, the reactive expression `simulation` *invalidates*.

## Reactive expressions

::: {.callout-caution title="Follow along!"}
Use a reactive expression to convert the name to ALLCAPS.

\vspace{1em}

Look at the reactive graph and see how it changes.
:::

## Preventing reactivity

Equally important to telling shiny **how** to react to changes, is describing **when** reactions should (not) occur.

\

. . .

The most useful way to prevent reactivity is with `req()`.

It is similar to `stop()`, silently ending the reactive chain.

`req()` *'requires'* inputs to be 'truthy' (not FALSE or empty).

<!-- This is useful for preventing code from running when no input is given, or if an invalid input is given. -->

## Preventing reactivity

::: {.callout-caution title="Follow along!"}
Use `req()` to prevent reactivity until text is entered.

\vspace{1em}

Update `req()` to require at least 3 characters inputted.
:::

## Preventing reactivity

Other ways reactivity might be prevented include:

* Event reactivity

  * `eventReactive(rnorm(input$n_samples), input$go)`
  * `observeEvent(input$go, message("Go!"))`
  
* Rate limiting

  * `throttle(reactive())`: limits update frequency
  * `debounce(reactive())`: waits for changes to stop

# Literate programming

## Literate programming

 * Due to Donald Knuth (Stanford), 1984
 * A script or document that contains an explanation of the program logic in a natural language (e.g. English), interspersed with snippets of source code, which can be compiled and rerun.
 * Generates two representations\newline from a source file: formatted\newline documentation and "tangled" code.

\placefig{10.5}{4.6}{width = 6cm}{WEB.png}

## Literate programming

* As a programming approach, it never quite caught on.
* But it has become the standard approach for reproducible documents.

## Literate programming examples

* WEB (combining Pascal and TeX)
* roxygen2 comments
  * technically documentation generation rather than literate programming
  * documentation embedded in code, rather than code embedded in documentation
* Sweave documents
* Jupyter notebooks
* Rmarkdown documents
* Quarto documents

# roxygen2
## roxygen2

* roxygen2 documentation are just comments to R.
* roxygen2::roxygenize():
  * generates documentation from these comments in the form of Rd files
  * adds relevant lines to the NAMESPACE file.
* roxygen2::roxygenize() is called by devtools::document().
* Advantage: keeps documentation with the code. More readable, less chance for errors.

# Rmarkdown

## Markdown syntax
\fontsize{14}{16}\sf
Markdown: a "markup" language for formatting text.

* Headings:

    `# Heading 1`\newline
    `## Heading 2`

* **Bold**: `**bold**`.
* *Italic*: `*italic*`.
* Blockquotes:

    `> blockquote`.

## Markdown and Rmarkdown

* Markdown (markup language):
  * Extension either `.md` or `.markdown`.
  * Used in many places on the web, in note-taking apps, etc.

* Rmarkdown (markup language):
  * an extension of markdown that allows for embedded R code chunks.
  * Extension `.Rmd`.

* Rmarkdown (package):
  * an R package that allows for the conversion of `.Rmd` files to other formats.

## Rmarkdown files

* Structure:
  1. YAML header
  2. Markdown content
  3. R code chunks surrounded by `` ```{r} `` and `` ``` ``
  4. Inline R surrounded by `` `r `` and `` ` ``

* Rmarkdown documents can be compiled to HTML, PDF, Word, and other formats
* Compile with `rmarkdown::render("file.Rmd")`

## Rmarkdown, knitr and pandoc

* `rmarkdown::render()`
  * Uses `knitr` to run all code chunks, and "knit" the results into a markdown file (replacing R chunks with output).
  * Uses `pandoc` to convert the markdown file to the desired output format.
  * If PDF output is desired, LaTeX then converts the tex file (from pandoc output) to pdf.

\centerline{\includegraphics[width = 10cm]{rmd.png}}

## knitr functions

* `knitr::knit()`: knits a single Rmd file --- runs all code chunks and replaces them with output in a markdown file.
* `knitr::purl()`: extracts all R code from an Rmd file and saves it to a new file.
* `knitr::spin()`: knits a specially formatted R script file into an Rmd file.

## Rmarkdown packages

  * rmarkdown (to html, pdf, docx, odt, rtf, md, etc.)
  * bookdown (to html, pdf, epub)
  * blogdown (to html) -- uses hugo rather than pandoc
  * xaringan (to html) -- uses remark.js rather than pandoc
  * beamer (to pdf)
  * rticles (to pdf)
  * tufte (to html, pdf)
  * vitae (to pdf)
  * distill (to html)
  * flexdashboard (to html)

## Some chunk options
\fontsize{14}{16}\sf

* `eval`: whether to evaluate the code chunk
* `echo`: whether to display the code chunk
* `include`: whether to include the code chunk in the output
* `results = 'hide'` hides printed output.
* `results = 'asis'` includes the output as is.
* `message`: whether to display messages
* `warning`: whether to display warnings
* `error = TRUE`: continue even if code returns an error.
* `fig.cap`: caption for the figure
* `fig.width`, `fig.height`: width and height of the figure
* `cache`: whether to cache the code chunk

## Global chunk options

````{verbatim}
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  comment = "#>",
  collapse = TRUE,
  echo = FALSE,
  message = FALSE,
  warning = FALSE
)
```
````

* The chunk named `setup` will be run before any other chunks.

## Debugging

* The Rmarkdown document is compiled in a different environment from your R console.
* If you get an error, try running all chunks (Ctrl+Alt+R).
* If you can't reproduce the error, check the working directory (add `getwd()` in a chunk).
* Try setting `error = TRUE` on problem chunk to help you diagnose what happens. (But change it back!)
* Look at the intermediate files (`.md` or `.tex`) to see what is happening.

## Caching


````{verbatim}
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)
```
````

or by chunk:

````{verbatim}
```{r, cache = TRUE}
```
````


## Caching

* When evaluating code chunks, knitr will save the results of chunks with caching to files to be reloaded in subsequent runs.
* Caching is useful when a chunk takes a long time to run.
* It will re-run if the code in the chunk changes in any way (even comments or spacing).
* Beware of inherited objects from earlier chunks. A chunk will not re-run if inherited objects change without explicit dependencies.
* Beware of dependence on external files.

## Caching

````{verbatim}
```{r chunk1, cache = TRUE}
x <- 1
```

```{r chunk2, cache = TRUE, dependson = "chunk1"}
y <- x*3
```
````

\pause

````{verbatim}
```{r chunk1, cache = TRUE}
x <- 1
```

```{r chunk2, cache = TRUE, cache.extra = x}
y <- x*3
```
````


## Caching

Cache will be rebuilt if:

* Chunk options change except `include`
* Any change in the code, even a space or comment
* An explicit dependency changes

Do not cache if:

 * setting R options like `options('width')`
 * setting knitr options like `opts_chunk$set()`
 * loading packages via `library()` if those packages are used by uncached chunks

## Caching with random numbers

````{verbatim}
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache.extra = knitr::rand_seed)
```
````

* `rand_seed` is an unevaluated expression.
* Each chunk will check if `.Random.seed` has been changed since the last run.
* If it has, the chunk will be re-run.

## Some caching options
\fontsize{14}{15}\sf

* `cache.comments` If `FALSE`, changing comments does not invalidate the cache.
* `cache.rebuild` If `TRUE`, the cache will be rebuilt even if the code has not changed. e.g.,\newline `cache.rebuild = !file.exists("some-file")`
* `dependson` A character vector of labels of chunks that this chunk depends on.
* `my_new_option` A new option that you can use in your code to invalidate the cache. e.g., `my_new_option = c(x,y)`
* `autodep` If `TRUE`, the dependencies are automatically determined. (May not be reliable.)

## Caching

Build automatic dependencies among chunks

````{verbatim}
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE, autodep = TRUE)
```
````

Make later chunks depend on previous chunks

````{verbatim}
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
dep_prev() # Don't use with `autodep = TRUE`
```
````

## Child documents

````{verbatim}
```{r, child=c('one.Rmd', 'two.Rmd')}
```
````

\pause\alert{Conditional inclusion}

````{verbatim}
```{r, child = if(condition) 'file1.Rmd' else 'file2.Rmd'}
```
````

\pause\alert{R Script files}


````{verbatim}
```{r, file = c("Rscript1.R", "Rscript2.R")}
```
````

* Better than `source("Rscript1.R")` because output of script included and dependencies tracked.

## Other language engines

````{verbatim}
```{python}
print("Hello Python!")
```
````

````{verbatim}
```{stata}
sysuse auto
summarize
```
````

* Python and Stata need to be installed with executables on `PATH`


## Other language engines
\fontsize{12}{12}\sf

```{r}
#| echo: true
names(knitr::knit_engines$get())
```

# Quarto

## Quarto
\fontsize{14}{16}\sf

* Generalization of Rmarkdown (not dependent on R)
* Supports R, Python, Javascript and Julia chunks by using either `knitr`, `jupyter` or `ObservableJS` engines.
* More consistent yaml header and chunk options.
* Many more output formats, and many more options for customizing format.
* Heavier reliance on pandoc Lua filters
* Uses pandoc templates for extensions

\centerline{\includegraphics[width = 10cm]{qmd.png}}

## Choose your engine

Specify the engine in the yaml header:

````{verbatim}
---
engine: knitr
---
````

````{verbatim}
---
engine: jupyter
jupyter: python3
---
````


**Default:** If any `{r}` blocks found, use `knitr` engine; otherwise use `jupyter` (with kernel determined by first block).


## Execute options

*   `execute` option in yaml header can be used instead of a `setup` chunk:

    ````{verbatim}
    execute:
      cache: true
      echo: false
      warning: false
    ````

* `setup` chunk still allowed.

## Chunk options

Rmarkdown syntax recognized for R chunks.

More consistent chunk options use the hash-pipe `#|`

````{verbatim}
```{r}
#| label: fig-chunklabel
#| fig-caption: My figure
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 4
mtcars |>
  ggplot(aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) +
  geom_point()
```
````

## Chunk options

* Quarto consistently uses hyphenated options (`fig-width` rather than `fig.width`)
* The Rmarkdown `knitr` options are recognized for backwards compatibility.
* Options that are R expressions need to be prefaced by `!expr`

  ````{verbatim}
  ```{r}
  #| fig-cap: !expr paste("My figure", 1+1)
  ```
  ````

## Extensions and templates
\fontsize{13}{17}\sf

* Quarto extensions modify and extend functionality.
* See <https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/> for a list.
* Templates are extensions used to define new output formats.
* Journal templates at\newline <https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/listing-journals.html>
* Monash templates at\newline <https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/quarto_templates.html>

## Exercise

* Create a quarto document using an html format
* Add a code chunk to generate a figure with a figure caption.
* Reference the figure in the text using `@fig-chunklabel`.
* Add the monash memo extension and generate a pdf output.
