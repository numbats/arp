If you believe the problem isn’t a bug, you should instead explain the intended behaviour and update the documentation to better explain what the function does.\nIn some cases, the problem reported may highlight a weakness in the package beyond the immediate issue. In these cases, you should also address the underlying weakness, and explain what you have done in the issue.\n\nNotes\n\nThe package will be developed on GitHub Classroom. Each team will be given a private repository for the assignment. The state of the repository at the time of the deadline will be counted as your submission. Commits after the deadline will be ignored.\nEach team member must contribute at least four substantive commits across multiple days. If the team mark is x, but a team member has not contributed adequately, that team member will receive a mark of 0 (for 0 commits), 0.25x (for 1 commit), 0.5x (for 2 commits), 0.75x (for 3 commits).
