# Debugging

## What's a bug?

An incorrect, unexpected, or unintended behaviour of code.

:::{.callout-tip}
## Why do we call it a bug?

Why not a mistake? A glitch? An oopsie-daisy?
:::

## What's a bug?

> On September 9, 1947, a real moth was found causing a malfunction in the Harvard Mark II computer. This incident was recorded in the logbook with the note "First actual case of bug being found."

## Overall debugging strategy

**Ask for help**

* Ask an LLM (OpenAI, Claude, ...)
* Ask a search engine (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, ...)
* Ask the community (Stack Overflow / Posit Community, ...)

**Fix it yourself**

* Update your software / R packages
* Create a minimal reproducible example
* Explore code to find where the error is
* Create a unit tests with expected behaviour
* Fix and test it

## Debugging tools in R
\vspace*{-0.2cm}
\fontsize{14}{15}\sf

* `traceback`: prints out the function call stack after an error occurs; does nothing if there's no error.
* `debug`: flags a function for "debug" mode which allows you to step through execution of a function one line at a time.
* `undebug`: removes the "debug" flag from a function.
* `browser`: pauses execution of a function and puts the function in debug mode.
* `trace`: allows you to insert code into a function at a specific line number.
* `untrace`: removes the code inserted by `trace`.
* `recover`: allows you to modify the error behaviour so that you can browse the function call stack after an error occurs.

## Traceback

```{r, error = TRUE}
f <- function(a) g(a)
g <- function(b) h(b)
h <- function(c) i(c)
i <- function(d) {
  if (!is.numeric(d)) stop("`d` must be numeric", call. = FALSE)
  d + 10
}
```

\only<2>{\includegraphics[width = 12cm]{../screenshots/debugging/rstudio-traceback.png}}
\pause\pause

```{r, eval = FALSE}
f("a")
#> Error: `d` must be numeric
traceback()
#> 5: stop("`d` must be numeric", call. = FALSE) at debugging.R#6
#> 4: i(c) at debugging.R#3
#> 3: h(b) at debugging.R#2
#> 2: g(a) at debugging.R#1
#> 1: f("a")
```

## Interactive debugging
\fontsize{13}{14}\sf

* Using `browser()`

  ```r
  i <- function(d) {
    browser()
    if (!is.numeric(d)) stop("`d` must be numeric", call. = FALSE)
    d + 10
  }
  ```

* Setting breakpoints
  * Similar to `browser()` but no change to source code.
  * Set in RStudio by clicking to left of line number, or pressing `Shift+F9`.
* `options(error = browser)`

## Interactive debugging

Debugging commands:

1. **`n`**: Next line (step over).
2. **`s`**: Step into function.
3. **`c`**: Continue to next breakpoint.
4. **`f`**: Finish the current function.
5. **`Q`**: Quit debugging.
6. **`where`**: Show the call stack.
7. **`help`**: Help with these debugging commands.

## Interactive debugging

* `debug()` : inserts a `browser()` statement at start of function.
* `undebug()` : removes `browser()` statement.
* `debugonce()` : same as `debug()`, but removes `browser()` after first run.

## Demo

Let's fix a real, unsolved bug.

[#mitchelloharawild/distributional/issues/133](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/distributional/issues/133)

``` r
distributional::dist_normal() * 2
#> Error in .mapply(get(op), list(x = vec_data(x), y = y)): argument "MoreArgs" is missing, with no default
```

## The debugging workflow

1. Create a reprex that demonstrates the problem as a comment in the issue.
2. Fix the problem in the package code.
3. Add a comment to the issue explaining the bug and the fix, including a link to the commit containing the fix.
4. Add unit test(s) to the package that confirms the problem is fixed.
5. Close the issue.

## Exercises

1.  What's wrong with this code?\fontsize{10}{10}\sf

    ```{r, error = TRUE}
    # Multivariate scaling function
    mvscale <- function(object) {
      # Remove centers
      mat <- sweep(object, 2L, colMeans(object))
      # Scale and rotate
      S <- var(mat)
      U <- chol(solve(S))
      z <- mat %*% t(U)
      # Return orthogonalized data
      return(z)
    }
    mvscale(mtcars)
    ```

## Asking for help

To get useful help, it is important that you ask a **good question**. Consider answering these two equivalent questions, which is easier to understand and why?

## urgent help needed with assignment error

My code doesn't work. Please help i need it working for my assignment asap!

data <- read.csv("C://Users/James/Downloads/project-a9j-2020a/files/survey_data.csv")

## Error with dplyr `filter()`: "object not found"

I'm trying to filter a dataset in `dplyr`, but I'm getting an error that I don't understand. Here's my code and error message:  

```r
survey <- data.frame(x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c("A", "B", "C"))
survey %>% filter(y == "A")
```
Error: `Error in filter(y == "A") : object 'y' not found`

I expected it to return rows where `y` is `"A"`. How should I fix this?

## Minimal reproducible examples

A minimal reproducible example (MRE) is essential for effectively communicating problems with code. 

The process of creating a MRE might also help you resolve the problem yourself!

## Minimal reproducible examples

**Minimal**

Minimising code and data makes it easier to find the problem.

- **Remove unnecessary code**
  
  Include as little code as possible to show the problem.
- **Use small datasets**
  
  Prefer built-in datasets or small example datasets.
- **Avoid external dependencies**
  
  Remove unused packages or files irrelevant to the problem.


## Minimal reproducible examples

**Reproducible**

- **Required packages**
  
  If external packages are needed, include loading the packages in your MRE.
- **Used datasets**
  
  If you can't use built-in datasets, provide a minimal dataset with `data.frame()` or `dput()`.
  
- **Set random seeds**
  
  If your problem includes randomisation, include `set.seed()` with appropriate seed.


## Minimal reproducible examples

**Examples**

- **Clearly state the issue**
  
  Explain what you expect versus what happens.
- **Ensure clarity**
  
  Add code comments to highlight your intention and the problem.

## reprex

The **reprex** package helps create *minimal reproducible examples*.

* Results are saved to clipboard in form that can be pasted into a GitHub issue, Stack Overflow question, or email.
* `reprex::reprex()`: takes R code and outputs it in a markdown format.
* Append session info with `reprex(..., session_info = TRUE)`.
* Use the RStudio addin.

## reprex as a debugging tool

Creating increasingly minimal reproducible examples can be a useful debugging tool.

Let's look at this bug:

[#tidyverts/fabletools/issues/350](https://github.com/tidyverts/fabletools/issues/350)

``` r
library(fpp3)
us_change %>%
  pivot_longer(c(Consumption, Income), names_to = "Time Series") %>%
  autoplot(value)
#> Error in `not_tsibble()`:
#> ! x is not a tsibble.
```

## Exercises

Create a Minimal Reproducible Example (MRE) for this code:

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(rainbow)

survey_data <- read.csv("https://arp.numbat.space/week4/survey_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)

survey_data |>
  select(-RespondentID) |>
  group_by(Gender) |>
  count(Satisfaction)
```
<https://arp.numbat.space/week4/survey_dplyr_bug.R>


## Non-interactive debugging

* Necessary for debugging code that runs in a non-interactive environment.
* Is the global environment different? Have you loaded different packages? Are objects left from previous sessions causing differences?
* Is the working directory different?
* Is the `PATH` environment variable, which determines where external commands (like `git`) are found, different?
* Is the `R_LIBS` environment variable, which determines where `library()` looks for packages, different?

## Non-interactive debugging

* `dump.frame()` saves state of R session to file.

  ```r
  # In batch R process ----
  dump_and_quit <- function() {
    # Save debugging info to file last.dump.rda
    dump.frames(to.file = TRUE)
    # Quit R with error status
    q(status = 1)
  }
  options(error = dump_and_quit)

  # In a later interactive session ----
  load("last.dump.rda")
  debugger()
  ```

* Last resort: `print()`: slow and primitive.

## Other tricks

* `sink()` : capture output to file.
* `options(warn = 2)` : turn warnings into errors.
* `rlang::with_abort()` : turn messages into errors.
* If R or RStudio crashes, it is probably a bug in compiled code.
* Post minimal reproducible example to Posit Community or Stack Overflow.

# Styling

## Style guides

**Tidyverse**

<https://style.tidyverse.org/>

**Google**

<https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html>

## Indentation

- Use **2 spaces** per indentation level.

- Add spaces around operators: `x <- y + z`.

## Naming (functions, arguments, objects)

Be brief but descriptive with object names.

Use a consistent naming convention:

- camelCase
- snake_case
- PascalCase

## Design

- **Modularity**: Create re-usable parts for maintainability and scalability.
- **Simplicity**: Keep the interface intuitive and easy to use with straightforward interactions.
- **Flexibility**: Allow adaptability to different use cases and user preferences.
- **Feedback**: Provide clear and timely feedback to inform users of actions, errors, and system states.


## Automatic styling

* styler: <https://styler.r-lib.org/>
* air: <https://posit-dev.github.io/air/>

These can be configured to automatically style your code when you save.

You can also check your code for common problems with [lintr](https://lintr.r-lib.org/).

# Profiling 

## Profiling functions

* `Rprof()` : records every function call.
* `summaryRprof()` : summarises the results.
* `profvis()` : visualises the results.

## Profiling

Where are the bottlenecks in your code?

```{r}
library(profvis)
library(bench)
f <- function() {
  pause(0.1)
  g()
  h()
}
g <- function() {
  pause(0.1)
  h()
}
h <- function() {
  pause(0.1)
}
```

## Profiling
\fontsize{10}{10}\sf

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tmp <- tempfile()
Rprof(tmp, interval = 0.1)
f()
Rprof(NULL)
writeLines(readLines(tmp))
#> sample.interval=100000
#> "pause" "g" "f"
#> "pause" "h" "g" "f"
#> "pause" "h" "f"
```

## Profiling
\fontsize{10}{10}\sf

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source(here::here("week4/profiling-example.R"))
profvis(f())
```

## Microbenchmarking
\fontsize{10}{10}\sf

### `system.time()`

```{r}
x <- rnorm(1e6)
system.time(min(x))
system.time(sort(x)[1])
system.time(x[order(x)[1]])
```

## Microbenchmarking
\fontsize{10}{10}\sf

### `bench::mark()`

```{r}
bench::mark(
  min(x),
  sort(x)[1],
  x[order(x)[1]]
)
```

## Microbenchmarking

* `mem_alloc` tells you the memory allocated in the first run.
* `n_gc` tells you the total number of garbage collections over all runs.
* `n_itr` tells you how many times the expression was evaluated.
* Pay attention to the units!

## Exercises

2.  What's the fastest way to compute a square root? Compare:

    - `sqrt(x)`
    - `x^0.5`
    - `exp(log(x) / 2)`

    Use `system.time()` find the time for each operation.

    Repeat using `bench::mark()`. Why are they different?

# Efficiency

## Vectorization

* Vectorization is the process of converting a repeated operation into a vector operation.
* The loops in a vectorized function are implemented in C instead of R.
* Using `map()` or `apply()` is **not** vectorization.
* Matrix operations are vectorized, and usually very fast.

## Exercises

Write the following algorithm to estimate $\displaystyle\int_0^1 x^2 dx$ using vectorized code

### Monte Carlo Integration
   a. Initialise: `hits = 0`
   b. for i in 1:N
      * Generate two random numbers,  $U_1, U_2$, between 0 and 1
      * If $U_2 < U_1^2$, then `hits = hits + 1`
   c. end for
   d. Area estimate = hits/N

# Caching

## Caching: using rds

```{r}
#| eval: false
if (file.exists("results.rds")) {
  res <- readRDS("results.rds")
} else {
  res <- compute_it()  # a time-consuming function
  saveRDS(res, "results.rds")
}
```

\pause\vspace*{1cm}

\alert{Equivalently\dots}

```{r}
#| eval: false
res <- xfun::cache_rds(
  compute_it(), # a time-consuming function
  file = "results.rds"
)
```

## Caching: using rds
\fontsize{10}{10}\sf

```{r}
#| label: cache1
#| cache: false
#| freeze: false
compute <- function(...) {
    xfun::cache_rds(rnorm(6), file = "results.rds", ...)
}
compute()
compute()
```

```{r}
#| include: false
#| cache: false
# Need to explicitly remove results.rds for some reason when doing this in quarto
file.remove(here::here("cache/results.rds"))
```

```{r}
#| label: cache2
#| cache: false
#| freeze: false
compute(rerun = TRUE)
compute()
```

## Caching: Rmarkdown

````{verbatim}
```{r import-data, cache=TRUE}
d <- read.csv('my-precious.csv')
```

```{r analysis, dependson='import-data', cache=TRUE}
summary(d)
```
````

* Requires explicit dependencies or changes not detected.
* Changes to functions or packages not detected.
* Good practice to frequently clear cache to avoid problems.
* targets is a better solution: Week 8

## Caching: Quarto

````{verbatim}
```{r}
#| label: import-data
#| cache: true
d <- read.csv('my-precious.csv')
```

```{r}
#| label: analysis
#| dependson: import-data
#| cache: true
summary(d)
```
````

* Same problems as Rmarkdown
* targets is a better solution: Week 8

## Caching: memoise

Caching stores results of computations so they can be reused.

\fontsize{10}{10}\sf

```{r}
library(memoise)
sq <- function(x) {
  print("Computing square of 'x'")
  x**2
}
memo_sq <- memoise(sq)
memo_sq(2)
memo_sq(2)
```

## Exercises

4. Use `bench::mark()` to compare the speed of `sq()` and `memo_sq()`.
