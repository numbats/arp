Customers always choose the shortest queue. The time between each new customer arriving at the checkouts has an exponential distribution with mean $\\mu$ minutes. The time it takes for a checkout operator to process a customer has an independent exponential distribution with mean $\\lambda$ minutes.\n\nWrite an R function to simulate the supermarket queues at each checkout, taking the arguments `mu`, `lambda`, `p` and `n`, and returning the total number of customers waiting to be served, `n` minutes after the supermarket opens. The argument `p` should have default value 3, while `n` should have default value `720` (the number of minutes in a 12 hour day). The other arguments should have no default values. Your function should be named `remaining_customers`.\n\nYour code should be as efficient as possible. Arguments should be checked for range and class.\n\n\n<br><br><hr><b>Due: 21 March 2025</b><br><a href=https://classroom.github.com/a/2XBwHan4 class = 'badge badge-large badge-blue'><font size='+2'>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>GitHub Classroom</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><br></a>\n",
