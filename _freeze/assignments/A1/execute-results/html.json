You must work together to complete the assignment, and submit a single solution for the group.\n\nWrite a package to do ?????\n\nYour code should demonstrate:\n\n  * Modular functions\n  * Default arguments\n  * Passing package checks\n  * Unit tests\n  * A short vignette explaining how to use the package\n  * All user-facing functions should have examples and unit tests.\n\n### Notes\n\n1. The package will be developed on GitHub Classroom. Each team will be given a private repository for the assignment. The state of the repository at the time of the deadline will be counted as your submission. Commits after the deadline will be ignored.\n\n2. Each team member must contribute at least four substantive commits across multiple days. If the team mark is x, but a team member has not contributed adequately, that team member will receive a mark of 0 (for 0 commits), 0.25x (for 1 commit), 0.5x (for 2 commits), 0.75x (for 3 commits). A maximum of 3 commits on any day will count in this calculation.\n\n3. Generative AI tools may be used in guided ways in this assessment, but you must explain how it was used, including prompts where relevant. Each assignment must include an AI statement. Evidence of AI use that is not mentioned in the statement will result in penalties being applied. Any work submitted for a mark must:\n\n    a. represent a sincere demonstration of your human efforts, skills and subject knowledge that you will be accountable for;\n    b. adhere to the guidelines for AI use set for the assessment task;\n    c. reflect the University’s commitment to academic integrity and ethical behaviour.\n\n   Inappropriate AI use and/or AI use without acknowledgement will be considered a breach of academic integrity.
