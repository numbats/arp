We encourage you to be creative and come up with your own ideas for how object oriented programming best suits your game package.\n\n### Ten-pin bowling:\n\n* Create a vctr to neatly print out frames of a game, including formatting for strikes, spares and splits.\n* Create methods for useful calculations like score, and `frame_strike()`, `frame_spare()`, `frame_closed()`, etc.\n\n### Blackjack:\n\n* Represent the cards with vctrs and provide functions/methods for things like `card_is_face()`, `card_value()`, `card_suit()`, etc.\n\n### Poker:\n\n* Represent the cards with vctrs and provide functions/methods for things like `card_is_face()`, `card_value()`, `card_suit()`, etc.\n\n## Snakes and ladders:\n\n* Represent the state of the board with vctrs, and create print methods to show the state of the game.\n\n<br><br><hr><b>Due: 6 June 2025</b><br><a href=https://classroom.github.com/a/??? class = 'badge badge-large badge-blue'><font size='+2'>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>GitHub Classroom</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><br></a>\n",
