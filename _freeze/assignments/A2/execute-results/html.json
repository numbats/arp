For each issue:\n\n1. Create a reprex that demonstrates the problem as a comment in the issue.\n2. Fix the problem in the package code.\n3. Add a comment to the issue explaining the bug and the fix, including a link to the commit containing the fix.\n4. Add unit test(s) to the package that confirms the problem is fixed.\n5. Close the issue.\n\nThe bug report may not fully describe the extent of the problem, and it may not really be a bug in the package. So you will need to understand what the functions are supposed to do, and then think about why the user has reported the problem. If you believe the problem isn't a bug, you should instead explain the intended behaviour and update the documentation to better explain what the function does.\n\nIn some cases, the problem reported may highlight a weakness in the package beyond the immediate issue. In these cases, you should also address the underlying weakness, and explain what you have done in the issue.\n\n<br><br><hr><b>Due: 11 April 2025</b><br><a href=https://classroom.github.com/a/??? class = 'badge badge-large badge-blue'><font size='+2'>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>GitHub Classroom</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><br></a>\n",
