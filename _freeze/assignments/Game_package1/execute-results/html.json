For example:\n\n* **Ten-pin bowling**: Calculate the score of a game where the inputs are the number of pins knocked down in each throw.\n* **Blackjack**: Calculate the score from a round where the inputs are the cards held by the player and the dealer at the end of the game.\n* **Poker**: Calculate the winner from a game where the inputs are the cards held by each player at the end of the game. Start with a simple version of poker, and extend to more complex versions.\n* **500**: Score a game of 500 where the inputs are the cards played by each player for each trick.\n* **Snakes & ladders**: Simulate a game of snakes and ladders on a specified board.\n* **Chess**: Simulate a game of chess with random but correct moves by each player.\n* **Uno**: Simulate a game of uno with random draws.\n\nYou may also have your own ideas for a game. If you would like to do something else, please discuss it with Mitch and Rob first.\n\nThe package should have at least 3 user-facing functions, and a vignette that describes how to use the package. The package should be well-documented, with all user-facing functions having examples and unit tests.\n\nMarks will be awarded for clean and efficient code, and for good design.\n\n<br><br><hr><b>Due: 16 May 2025</b><br><a href=https://classroom.github.com/a/??? class = 'badge badge-large badge-blue'><font size='+2'>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>GitHub Classroom</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><br></a>\n",
