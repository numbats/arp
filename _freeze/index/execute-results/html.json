This unit delves into R from the programming aspect instead of using it as a data analysis tool. You will learn a variety of programming paradigms and delve into the foundations of R as a programming language.\n\n## Learning outcomes\n\n1. be familiar with the foundations of R programming\n2. understand a variety of programming paradigms, including functional programming and object-oriented programming\n3. utilise R’s functional and object-oriented programming systems\n4. integrate the concept of metaprogramming to evaluate and construct new functions\n\n## Teachers\n\n* [**Rob J Hyndman**](https://robjhyndman.com).
