Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.\n\nWhen you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(mtcars)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n      mpg             cyl             disp             hp       \n Min.   :10.40   Min.   :4.000   Min.   : 71.1   Min.   : 52.0  \n 1st Qu.:15.43   1st Qu.:4.000   1st Qu.:120.8   1st Qu.: 96.5  \n Median :19.20   Median :6.000   Median :196.3   Median :123.0  \n Mean   :20.09   Mean   :6.188   Mean   :230.7   Mean   :146.7  \n 3rd Qu.:22.80   3rd Qu.:8.000   3rd Qu.:326.0   3rd Qu.:180.0  \n Max.   :33.90   Max.   :8.000   Max.   :472.0   Max.   :335.0  \n      drat             wt             qsec             vs        \n Min.   :2.760   Min.   :1.513   Min.   :14.50   Min.   :0.0000  \n 1st Qu.:3.080   1st Qu.:2.581   1st Qu.:16.89   1st Qu.:0.0000  \n Median :3.695   Median :3.325   Median :17.71   Median :0.0000  \n Mean   :3.597   Mean   :3.217   Mean   :17.85   Mean   :0.4375  \n 3rd Qu.:3.920   3rd Qu.:3.610   3rd Qu.:18.90   3rd Qu.:1.0000  \n Max.   :4.930   Max.   :5.424   Max.   :22.90   Max.   :1.0000  \n       am              gear            carb      \n Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :3.000   Min.   :1.000  \n 1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.:3.000   1st Qu.:2.000  \n Median :0.0000   Median :4.000   Median :2.000  \n Mean   :0.4062   Mean   :3.688   Mean   :2.812  \n 3rd Qu.:1.0000   3rd Qu.:4.000   3rd Qu.:4.000  \n Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :5.000   Max.   :8.000  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Including Plots\n\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Fuel efficiency plotted against vehicle weight. Heavier cars use more fuel than lighter cars.](Qmd_example_files/figure-pdf/fig-plot-1.pdf){#fig-plot}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that the `echo: false` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot shown in @fig-plot.\n",
