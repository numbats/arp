Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.\n\nWhen you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(cars)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n     speed           dist       \n Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  \n 1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  \n Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  \n Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  \n 3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  \n Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Including Plots\n\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Qmd_example_files/figure-html/pressure-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that the `echo: false` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n",
